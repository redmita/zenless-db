		"desc": "*1.6 Prydwen Tier List (12/03/2025)*\n\nWith the release of S0 Anby, and an accumulation of data over a number of phases since our last update, we’re making some substantial changes to the tier list - specifically the Damage category. In recent phases of Shiyu Defense a divide between damaging characters currently in the Apex tier has emerged. To address this we’re introducing Tier 4, re-organizing the tiers, and adjusting the ratings of some characters.\n\nAfter the release of Miyabi, Evelyn and now S0 Anby it’s clear the bar for damage dealers has been set higher. To reflect this reality, we’ve had adjust the rating of some older damage dealers down the tier list. With that said these characters are by no means bad, or unable to clear endgame content, they simply don’t destroy it quite at the same pace as the most recent additions to the damage dealing roster. To ensure the tier list still makes sense and each character is in a tier with peers that reflect a similar power level we’ve introduced an additional Tier (Tier 4) and shuffled the majority of characters down the tier list. In addition to this change we’ve also adjusted the meta line indicating what is a niche character and what is a meta character from sitting between Tier 1.5 and Tier 2 to sit between Tier 2 and Tier 3 instead.\n\nThe goal of all these changes isn’t to “drop every character on the tier list” it’s to ensure that each character is grouped with other characters of a similar power level something the previous iteration of the tier list wasn’t quite achieving.\nOutside of this here are a few characters movements we feel deserve their own explanation:\n\n- *[Zhu Yuan] & [Jane doe].* Both remain powerful Agents but are struggling to keep up with other characters residing in the Apex Tier in terms of clear times in the latest phases of Shiyu Defense. If and when the encounters favor them more and they’re able to make a comeback we’ll return them to the highest tiers.\n- *[Piper].* She is one of the few units we’re not shuffling down as a result of this change as she’s put out some incredibly convincing results in more recent Shiyu phases. We’re keeping her in Tier 1 for now but will keep an eye on her to see if she can maintain her performance.\n- *[Qingyi].* We’re placing Qingyi on the watchlist for now. She hasn’t been performing at the level we expect of a Tier 0 stunner and isn’t as meta relevant when it comes to forming teams with Apex Damage dealers as some of her peers. With that said she can be played alongside S0 Anby, so we’re keeping an eye on her for now and seeing how she performs in the coming phase."

		"desc": "*1.5-2 Prydwen Tier List (12/02/2025)*\n\n- *[Evelyn]* has been added to the tier list.\n- We’re placing Evelyn in T0.5 initially with the Expert Tag. This Tag indicates that in the hands of a beginner or “average” player she sits around the T0.5 level, but in the hands of an expert she performs at a T0 level, equivalent to Miyabi. We feel this placement is a reasonable starting point for her considering her difficulty - some consider her incredibly simple and easy to play while others find her more challenging. We’ll be monitoring how the community receives Evelyn - if she’s easier to grasp and play at the highest level than expected we’ll remove the Expert tag from her and raise her to T0, but if she turns out to be just as hard as some fear, we’ll keep her where she is for now.\n- With the arrival of Evelyn and the upcoming release of Anby: Silver Soldier we expect shifts to occur over the next few Shiyu Defense phases in the DPS Category of the Tier List. We are aware that some Apex DPS characters aren’t performing quite as well as they were in the past or to the level some of their peers are currently at. With that said we’ll be holding off on any major changes until the release of Anby: Silver Soldier to see where the meta settles. We already watchlisted Jane Doe because of that, because of all T0.5 characters she had the roughest performance drop recently."

		"desc": "*1.5 Prydwen Tier List (22/01/2025)*\n\n- *[Astra Yao]* has been added to the tier list.\n- Based on the previous feedback of the major rework to our Shiyu Defense Tier list, alongside the latest data performance we’re making a few adjustments to some character’s rankings in addition to the placement of Astra Yao on the tier list.\n- *[Piper] Up.* Piper has continued to demonstrate success in Shiyu as an accessible Anomaly option with strong team options. She was ranked too low as a result of the merge, we’re fixing that with this update.\n- *[Soldier 11] Down.* Based on feedback received, new/Additional clear data and further testing, the general consensus is that Soldier 11 isn’t currently performing at Ellen’s level. As a result we’re lowering Soldier 11’s tier by one rank for now.\n- *[Harumasa].* Harumasa is a character with great potential when played optimally, something that isn’t for everyone. We’ve ranked Harumasa under the assumption that he would be played according to his strongest combos, but this isn’t always realistic due to combat scenarios or player skill/playstyle. In recognition of this, we’re introducing the new Expert Tag to the tier list to both recognize his potential but also highlight his higher skill requirements. For those who can play him to his full potential his effective position on the tier list is unchanged as per the Expert tags description, for those who can’t his new placement applies.\n- *Expert Tag:* Characters tagged with the Expert Tag can be considered one placement higher than their tier list ranking, but you need to master their advanced/harder playstyle for them to qualify for that higher rating."

		"desc": "*1.4 Prydwen Tier List (18/12/2024)*\n\n- *[Miyabi]* has been added to the tier list,\n- *[Harumasa]* has been added to the tier list,\n- *We have combined the Pure DPS and Anomaly DPS columns into one column - DPS.* We’ve intended on doing this for a while now but the release of Miyabi solidified the decision. The Anomaly Category was created under the premise that Anomaly characters would play vastly different to Attack characters much like Grace is different than a character like Soldier 11. This is not how things played out post release. A lot of Anomaly characters function as direct damage dealers akin to Attack characters with the main distinction being one stacks Anomaly related stats and the other stacks CRIT but now with Miyabi even that line is blurred. In ZZZ under the current meta we feel Attack and Anomaly characters can directly be compared in terms of performance, their roles are not different enough to keep them separate and so we have combined them. As a result of this change some characters ranking have been updated to make sense. As always we’ll be reading your feedback,\n- We have added the *meta-lines* that are already present in our other tier lists. They split the tier list into 3 groups, showcasing roughly how they are currently used in the meta: Apex (best of the best), Meta (great characters) and Niche (characters with issues that require more work to achieve good results). There's no Forgotten Ones group yet as the meta isn't in as bad state as HSR and everyone is viable - more or less,\n- We have added a new tag - *Quick Swap.* The tag highlights characters that benefit greatly from swapping to another character during one or many of their abilities that have incredibly long animations. This allows this downside to be mitigated.\n- We have changed the color of the Anomaly related tags like Shock, Burn and Disorder to make them stand out a bit more."
